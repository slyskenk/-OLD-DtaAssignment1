This project provides an in-depth analysis of crimes against women across various states in India from 2001 to 2021.
It features interactive visualizations that highlight trends over time, compare crime rates between states,
and break down the distribution of different crime types such as domestic violence, dowry deaths, rape, and kidnapping. 
This project aims to offer insights into the evolving landscape of women's safety in India, helping stakeholders identify areas that require attention and resources.
